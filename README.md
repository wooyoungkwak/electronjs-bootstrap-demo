# electron-demo-bootstrap

** Electron 을 실행 하려면 다음과 같이 따라하시면 됩니다. **

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [demo-bootstrap Guide](https://github.com/wooyoungkwak/electronjs-bootstrap-demo.git) within the Electron documentation.

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](https://electronjs.org/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.
